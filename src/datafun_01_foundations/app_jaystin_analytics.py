# === DECLARE IMPORTS (BRING IN FREE CODE) ===

# === CONFIGURE LOGGER ONCE PER MODULE (PYTHON FILE) ===

LOG: logging.Logger = get_logger("P01", level="INFO")


# === DECLARE GLOBAL CONSTANTS ===

# All these global variables are CONSTANT, they do NOT change when the program runs.
# By convention, constants are named in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
# The following illustrates variables that hold these common types:
#    str, int, float, bool, list of strings.
# `Final` is added to indicate these variables should not be reassigned.
# Examples:

MY_ANALYTICS_COMPANY: Final[str] = "DataFun Analytics"
MY_EMPLOYEE_COUNT: Final[int] = 150

# See the other file for examples.
MY_CITY: Final[str] = "Honolulu"

MY_BIRTH_YEAR: Final[int] = 1998

MY_MONTH_DAY: Final[float] = 8.31

MY_IS_STUDENT: Final[bool] = True

# REQ: Strings must be in quotes and items are separated by commas,
# REQ: The list is wrapped in square brackets. (See the other file for examples.)
MY_HOBBIES: Final[list[str]] = ["running", "reading", "gaming", "shopping"]
